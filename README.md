# Lung_Cancer_Classification_Project

This represents my final project progress. Includes custom functions made to reduce lines of code. I have added two new custom functions not included in the other repository. One of them seems to have a minor bug(AUC ROC curve) that I am trying to fix. The analysis is also not fully complete. The next step is hyperparameter tuning.
